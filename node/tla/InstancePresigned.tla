(* The real, legitimate forward progression (instance_btc_tx_monitor,      *)

AdvancePastPresigned ==
    /\ status = "Presigned"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(* The race: store_graph / update_graph_status_guarded writing Presigned   *)
(* as a side effect, reachable from an independent P2P/rescan path.        *)

\* As originally written: unconditional, matching the confirmed bug.
SetPresignedUnguarded ==
    status' = "Presigned"

\* The actual fix: set_instance_presigned_guarded, node/src/utils.rs -
\* only writes Presigned if the instance hasn't already moved past it.
SetPresignedGuarded ==
    /\ status \in {"Early", "Presigned"}
