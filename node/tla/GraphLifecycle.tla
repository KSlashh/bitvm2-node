\* The actual fix (update_graph_status_guarded, node/src/utils.rs) has TWO
\* guards, not one - a first draft with only guard (1) still let TLC find a
\* liveness bug: GoatPostGraphData could still knock an OperatorKickOff graph
\* back to OperatorDataPushed, which combined with Obsoleted's resurrection
\* edges cycles forever and never reaches a terminal status.
\*   (1) refuse to write OFF a closed/terminal status onto something else.
\*   (2) refuse OperatorDataPushed specifically unless the graph hasn't yet
\*       progressed past it (OperatorDataPushed only causally precedes
\*       PreKickoff in the real system - a correctly functioning node never
\*       needs to "re-push" data after kickoff has already happened).
